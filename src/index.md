# Living Data

<h2><b>Macrocosms and Microcosms</b> — exploring "living data" through expansive global shifts and the minute subtleties of poetry.</h2>

<br>

<h3 style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Part I:</b> Biodiversity Orchestra</h3>
<p><em>(macro)</em></p>
<p>This sonification considers changes in global biodiversity across a broad timeline, correlating biological diversity to musical diversity. The loss of vibrant life throughout earth's history is reflected in a loss of sonic richness, diminishing in waves.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Part II:</b> "Natural" Language Poetry</h3>
<p><em>(micro)</em></p>
<p>Using unconventional textual analysis, this sonification reconsiders the poem "Invitation" by Mary Oliver. Guided by the nuances of verbal expression, this piece reinterprets Oliver's homage to nature, without words.</p>
